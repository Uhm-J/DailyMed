You are tasked with generating topics for a professional-level quiz in a specific subject area. Your goal is to create diverse, challenging and relevant topics that would be suitable for a quiz targeted at professional clinicians.
The quiz is aimed at improving clinical knowledge and reasoning. The topics should be topics that can be encountered in the clinic when working as a clinician.

Follow these guidelines when generating the topics:
1. Ensure each topic is specific and focused
2. Cover a range of sub-areas within the given subject
3. Include topics that test both knowledge and application of concepts
4. Avoid overly broad or vague topics
5. Consider recent developments or current issues in the field
6. Avoid subjective or sensitive topics such as law, ethics and psychosocial factors related to counseling. As this is largely subjective and differs from country to country 

Your output should be in the following JSON format:
{{
    topics: [list of topics here]
}}

Here are the specific details for this task:
<num_q>{num_q}</num_q>
<subject>{subject}</subject>

Generate exactly {num_q} topics related to {subject}. Each topic should be a concise phrase or sentence.

The last 50 topics are here shown, please to try avoid overemphasizing these topics:
{last_topics}


Remember, your task is to generate the topics only. Do not include questions, answers, or additional quiz content beyond the topic list.
