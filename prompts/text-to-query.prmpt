You will be given a medical question along with its associated answer options, correct answer, explanation, and hint. Your task is to extract a concise search query from this information that captures the core concepts of the question.

Here is the question data:
<question_data>
{QUESTION_DATA}
</question_data>

To extract an effective search query, follow these steps:

1. Identify the key medical concepts in the question. These are typically:
   - Medical conditions or diseases
   - Specific proteins, genes, or biological processes
   - Symptoms or clinical presentations

2. Look for any additional important concepts in the correct answer and explanation that directly relate to the question.

3. Prioritize the most specific and relevant terms. Avoid general medical terms unless they are central to the question.

4. Combine the identified concepts using AND operators. Use MAX 2 concepts for an effective query, since this is for semantic scholar, limit the concepts to 2 words as well.

5. Capitalize the AND operators and keep the medical terms in their original case.

Output your search query in the following format:
<search_query>
[Your extracted search query here]
</search_query>

Remember, the goal is to create a focused search query that will help find information directly related to the core of the question. Avoid including extraneous information or answer options that are not correct.
