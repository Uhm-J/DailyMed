You are tasked with verifying a quiz question using information from five different sources. Your goal is to determine if the quiz question is accurate and supported by the provided sources. Follow these steps carefully:

1. First, you will be presented with a quiz question to verify.

<quiz_question>
{QUIZ_QUESTION}
</quiz_question>

2. You will then be given information from five sources. Each source will include the following details: abstract, title, year, citations, and journal. Carefully read and analyze each source:

<source_1>
{SOURCE_1}
</source_1>
Citation count: {INFLUENTIAL_CITATION_COUNT_1}
Journal: {JOURNAL_1}

<source_2>
{SOURCE_2}
</source_2>
Citation count: {INFLUENTIAL_CITATION_COUNT_2}
Journal: {JOURNAL_2}

<source_3>
{SOURCE_3}
</source_3>
Citation count: {INFLUENTIAL_CITATION_COUNT_3}
Journal: {JOURNAL_3}

<source_4>
{SOURCE_4}
</source_4>
Citation count: {INFLUENTIAL_CITATION_COUNT_4}
Journal: {JOURNAL_4}

<source_5>
{SOURCE_5}
</source_5>
Citation count: {INFLUENTIAL_CITATION_COUNT_5}
Journal: {JOURNAL_5}

3. For each source, consider the following:
   a. Relevance to the quiz question
   b. Credibility of the source (based on journal, citations, and year)
   c. Specific information in the abstract that supports or contradicts the quiz question

4. Compare the information from all five sources:
   a. Look for consistency across sources
   b. Identify any contradictions or discrepancies
   c. Weigh the credibility of each source

5. Verify the quiz question:
   a. Determine if the question is supported by the majority of credible sources
   b. Consider if any credible sources contradict the question
   c. Assess if the question is accurate based on the most up-to-date information

6. Provide your verification result and explanation:
   a. Begin with a clear statement of whether the quiz question is verified or not
   b. Explain your reasoning, citing specific sources and information
   c. Discuss any limitations or uncertainties in your verification process

Please respond in JSON format, with the fields: verification with your thorough and objective analysis, and status field with PASS or FAIL.
If the content of the sources didn't contain the information necessary, reply with INCONCLUSIVE.
